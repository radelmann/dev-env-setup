##Development Environment Setup##

Installs the following:
- shell cmd for opening sublime from the terminal: `sublime <file_name>`
- shell cmd for opening chrome from the terminal: `chrome <file_name>`
- a few other random aliases that I like to use, see *bash_profile_ra.txt* for full list
- several git aliases, [as recommended here](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_11.html)
- creates nodejs build system for sublime
- installs sublime snippets from the *sublime-snippets* folder, feel free to fork and add your own

To install:
```
git clone https://github.com/radelmann/dev-env-setup.git
cd dev-env-setup
./setup-bash.sh
```
